# 📕 Game Developement Book Projects 📕
These are game projects I created using the help of the book: Beginning C++ Game Programming 2nd Edition.
I already know the basics of programming covered in the book, but wanted an interactive way to learn C++, as well as using https://www.learncpp.com/ in tandem.

The library used in this book is: SFML.
